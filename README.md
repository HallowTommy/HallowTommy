# Hi there! 👋

My name is **Nikita**, I’m **29**, and I live in **Minsk, Belarus**.  
I’m a **backend developer** with about **3 years** of experience. Before switching to engineering, I worked in **marketing and business** — launching projects, validating hypotheses, and building processes and communication. My current focus is **Python backend development** and growing into a strong engineer.

## Tech stack & tools

**Languages**
- Python (primary)
- Rust (integration / performance-critical parts)
- Shell / PowerShell (utilities, automation)

**Backend / API**
- Django, DRF
- FastAPI (ASGI)
- REST APIs, third-party integrations, working with API documentation

**Async / Networking**
- aiogram (Telegram Bot API)
- aiohttp / httpx
- websockets

**Databases & storage**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- SQLAlchemy, migrations, basic schema design
- Redis
- asyncpg

**DevOps / Deployment**
- Docker, Docker Compose
- VPS (Ubuntu): deployment, environment setup, SSL, domains
- Reverse proxy: Caddy / Nginx
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD): build/check/deploy automation

**Crypto / Blockchain**
- Solana ecosystem: understanding transactions, RPC interactions, and common scenarios
- Solana-related Python/Rust libraries (used in practice in my projects)

---

## What I do

- Build services and APIs: auth, CRUD, data processing, third-party integrations.
- Build Telegram bots: flows, async requests, data storage.
- Deliver projects end-to-end: structure, environment, containerization, VPS deployment.
- Use Rust / low-level approaches when performance or control matters.

## Goal

To grow as a **Python backend developer**, work on real products, strengthen engineering skills, and gradually take more responsibility for architecture and quality.
